# React Note-Taking App

A simple note-taking app built with React that allows users to add, view, and edit notes. The app uses `localStorage` to persist notes on the client-side, ensuring that data is saved across page reloads. The app is designed with a clear UI, thoughtful state management, and smooth animations using `react-spring`.

## Features
